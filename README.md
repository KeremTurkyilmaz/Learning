# Learning

This repository is my personal space to experiment and deepen into some themes that I find interesting. I decided to contribute, in my own little, to the Open Source Initiative (OSI) as in recent years I have always learned from others by peering behind the scenes of their projects. This repository is not intended to be a guide, but rather a place that can be consulted in search of new stimuli.

#### Changelog

As I said this repository contains different types of personal experiments and researches. When I'm experimenting with some new stuff I prefer to go straight and not block myself unless I achieved some kind of results, so I commit only at the end of the day. This isn't the best way to track the progress inside of a project, but given the particularity of this project I prefer to do less commit and not to lose the concentration.
